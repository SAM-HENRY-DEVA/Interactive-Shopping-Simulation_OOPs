**Sam SuperMarket Simulation**

Welcome to the **Sam SuperMarket Simulation**! This project is a Python-based program that simulates a supermarket shopping experience. It includes inventory management, customer interaction, and billing functionalities, all wrapped up in an interactive console-based system.

**Purpose**
The primary goal of this project is to demonstrate the use of **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** concepts in Python, such as:
- **Class and Objects**
- **Methods** for functionality
- **Data Encapsulation**
- Handling **dynamic user inputs**

**Features**
1. **Product Inventory Management**:
   - View available products, quantities, and prices in the supermarket.
   - Automatic updates to inventory when items are added to or removed from the cart.

2. **Customer Shopping Experience**:
   - Add products to the shopping cart with real-time quantity validation.
   - Remove items from the cart with adjustable quantities.
   - View cart details, including a breakdown of costs, GST (18%), and the total bill.

3. **Interactive Menu Options**:
   - **Products Availability**: View inventory details.
   - **Customer Details**: Display customer profile and cart summary.
   - **Add to Cart**: Add available products to the shopping cart.
   - **Remove Product from Cart**: Remove or adjust quantities in the cart.
   - **Customer Support**: Display toll-free and contact numbers.
   - **Exit**: End the simulation with a thank-you note.

4. **Human-Friendly Billing System**:
   - Calculates subtotal, GST (18%), and total cost dynamically.
   - Ensures a smooth shopping experience for customers.
